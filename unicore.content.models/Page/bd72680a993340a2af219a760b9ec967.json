  "content": "Angela\u2019s cousin, an avid U-reporter since 2012, sent a message looking for a solution to 12 year old Angela\u2019s dilemma, whose father plotted with the village witchdoctor to have her sacrificed.  Angela is the first born in her family, and has nine younger siblings. Her father wants to sacrifice her, since she is the eldest child. \r\n\r\nAfter learning of her father\u2019s evil intentions, her mum and auntie notified the authorities and decided to move Angela to another village. Although not yet totally out of danger, Angela has resumed school in a different sub county, where it is hoped that her father will not reach her. In the meantime, the authorities await her father\u2019s return from the neighbouring country where he has gone into hiding. \r\n\r\nChild sacrifice is the harmful practice of removing a child\u2019s body parts, blood or tissue while the child is alive. The body parts are removed and sold to people who believe they can get quick wealth, overcome illness, and obtain blessings.\r\n\r\n",
